# manage-state-in-vue-application-with-vuex

* execute an action that in turn calls a mutation
* have multiple mutations inside of an action
* mutations have one job and one job only: update the store
* Actions can do a number of different things including combining data, fetching data, and running JavaScript logic
* A getter is a way to combine multiple state values into a single value
```sh
npm install vuex@next --save
```
* can think of Vuex getters as computed properties for your Vuex store.
